# Posh-Teamviewer Module

The Teamviewer PowerShell Module allows users to connect and edit device properties using the Teamviewer API. Online Documentation can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/posh-teamviewer/)

## Installation

Install from PSGallery.

```powershell
PS> Install-Module -Name Posh-Teamviewer
```

## Set Access Token

To get started create a Teamviewer script Access Token. For detailed insctructions follow this guide: [Create Script](https://integrate.teamviewer.com/en/develop/api/get-started/#createScript). You can also find the full API Documentation here: [API Documentation](https://integrate.teamviewer.com/en/develop/api/documentation/). Once you have your Access Token, use the command `Set-TeamviewerAccessToken` to store the Access Token and set the variable `$Global:TeamviewerAccessToken`. This command encrypts the AccessToken in a file located at `$env:APPDATA\Teamviewer` using PBKDF2 to derive a key with a Master Password and salt. Special thanks to [Carlos Perez](https://github.com/darkoperator) for the Code and Help associated with this. Here is an example of Setting the Access Token.

```powershell
PS> Set-TeamviewerAccessToken -AccessToken '1234-SWDwf23vawef4122345asfg'
```

## Load Saved Access Token

To Load an encrypted Access Token into the Current Session, run the following Command:

```powershell
PS> Initialize-Teamviewer -MasterPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString)
```

This command will set the following variables:

* **$Global:TeamviewerAccessToken** - The Teamviewer Access Token.
* **$Global:TeamviewerConfigPath** - The Path to the Teamviewer Appdata Folder.
* **$Global:TeamviewerDeviceList** - A stored list of Device Details from the Teamviewer API.

> **NOTE:** Teamviewer requires a Device ID to query that devices information. When **Initialize-Teamviewer** is used at the start of a session, it runs **Set-TeamviewerDeviceList** in the background to build an initial list of Device Details. This is to help in situations where an account has a very large number of devices attached to it. Responses could take upwards of 30 or more seconds when gathering information on thousdands of devices. **Initialize-Teamviewer** may run slightly longer than expected due to this, but keeps the time of the other commands to a minimum.

## Updating the Device List

The first way To update the Device List is to use **Update-DeviceList**. If you need the Device Information to be up to date before running a specific command that relies on this list, a switch parameter `-UpdateDeviceList` is available that will update the List at the beginning of the command.
